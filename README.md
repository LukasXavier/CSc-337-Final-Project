# CSc-337-Final-Project

This was a small 4-month project to implement what we learned throughout the semester, while also including
something that we had to learn by ourselves.

## Node packages used:  
  mongoose  
  express  
  cookie-parser  
  socket.io  
  socket.io-cookie-parser  
  crypto  
  
## Brief
We were able to implement a functional online game of Uno, allowing for mutliple lobbies to active at the same
time while also supporting lobby sizes of 2-4.

### Known Bugs
  Using Firefox results in stats not being updated after a game ends
